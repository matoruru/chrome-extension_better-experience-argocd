# Better Experience for Argo CD

Adds a realtime-filter feature for input fields such as Project Name, Repository URL and Cluster URL.

### Problem

Argo CD's UI doesn't filter those values in a list based on your input so as the number of values increases it causes a looooong scroll for you to reach the value that you want.

### Why you need this

This extension solves the problem above by providing a realtime-filter feature which updates the displayed list based on your input.
